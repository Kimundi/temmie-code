Learning to code with Temmie!

This is a website that tries to teach the very basics of coding - writing down a list of commands and letting them execute in order - by dressing the concept up in a cute skin (giving orders to a dog).

It's based on the ideas of [Turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics).

Note that I threw this repo together in just a few days while not having any experience with web development, so 
enter the HTML and JS only with Hazmat suits :wink:.

This is based on https://github.com/bjpop/js-turtle, which was the first google result that seemed to be easy enough to hack on.
